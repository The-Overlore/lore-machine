Straejelas depends on both wheat and minerals. \n\nJames: But Paul, look at the gold we can get for just a grain of our wheat! \n\nLisa: Yes, we should be investing more in our mining initiatives.\n\nPaul: While I agree that deal is superficially advantageous, we traded a mountain of wheat for practically nothing earlier today. We need a balanced approach.  \n\nDaniel: You farmers just want more for yourselves, bloated with gluttony and greed.\n\nNancy: That's unfair, Daniel! We are all working for the benefit of Straejelas. We are happy as a realm and must remain united against threats, be it hunger or outside forces.\n\nPaul: Exactly, Nancy. The strength and happiness of our realm resides in the balance of our efforts. Walking the path of greed will only lead us to ruin. We cannot sacrifice our self-sustainability in the name of temporary wealth.\n\nJames: Maybe you're right, Paul. As long as we are safe and fed, the gold is just a bonus. We should indeed be more mindful about our trades. \n\nPaul: That's the spirit, James. Together, we'll keep Straejelas thriving and prosperous.\n\n"

        "message": "Nancy: James, I can't believe the realm traded our hard-earned wheat for a mere piece of gold. Such blatant disrespect for our efforts!\n\nJames: Well, Nancy you have to look at the bigger picture. Yes, we traded a vast amount of wheat, but we also made an exceedingly profitable trade.\n\nNancy: Profitable trade? Please, do enlighten me.\n\nJames: We also traded a single measly piece of wheat for an astronomical amount of gold.\n\nLisa (interrupting): James, your words make no difference. The blatantly uneven trade done for our wheat is a mockery of our hard work!\n\nDaniel (angrily): I agree with Lisa. Nancy's anger is justified and your attempt to pacify her by highlighting one profitable trade is lame!\n\nPaul: Not just lame, it's ignoble! We, farmers, and miners risk our lives in the fields and mines, and what do we get? A single piece of gold!\n\nJames (calmly): I understand your frustrations. But we need to have faith in our realm's decisions. There will always be ups and downs in trade. We must believe in the overall prosperity of our home, Straejelas. \n\nNancy: Prosperity it seems, at the cost of our respect and toil!\n\n"
